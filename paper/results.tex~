\section{Linear simulations}\label{simulations}
We adopt units such that $G=M_*=1$. Our main calculations are
summarized in Table \ref{linsims}. For these runs the computational
domain is $R\in[0.4,1.6]r_0$, $Z\in[0,Z_s]=[0,0.9]$, and 
$\alpha=0.5$ for the power-law part of the surface density 
profile. The bump radius, amplitude and width are set to $r_0=1$,
$A=1.4$ and $\Delta r=0.05r_0$, respectively. 
We consider modes with $m=3$ unless otherwise stated. 
Slightly different setups are employed in \S\ref{isothermal} to
explore the isothermal limit.   

The new parameter for nonhomentropic disks, 
compared to homentropic flow in \citetalias{lin12}, is the adiabatic index
$\gamma$. We therefore focus on examining the effect of entropy
gradients due to $\gamma\ne\Gamma$. Cases 0---4 have fixed polytropic index
$n=1.5$, and therefore identical background density and velocity profiles,
but variable adiabatic index $\gamma \geq 5/3$. 
Cases 5---8 have fixed adiabatic index $\gamma=1.4$, but variable polytropic 
index $n\geq 2.5$. 

%It should be noted that 
%Â§with other parameters fixed, increasing $n$ decreases the bump in disk thickness. 

An example of nonhomentropic equilibrium, with $n=1.5$ ($\Gamma=5/3$)
and $\gamma=2.5$, is shown in Fig. \ref{fiducial_basic} (case 3).
The generalized vortensity and $\kappa^2+N^2$ are plotted. 
As expected for a density bump, the generalized vortensity has a local
minimum at $r=r_0$. It corresponds to $\mathrm{min}(\kappa^2/\Omega_k^2)=0.43$. 
The increase in $\kappa^2+N^2$ with respect to
height is due to $N_z^2$ (since $N_r\sim h N_z$ near the upper
boundary). Note that $N_z^2\gtrsim\Omega^2$ for
$|z|\gtrsim0.7H$ in this case.

\subsection{Homentropic reference case}
For comparison purposes, we reproduce the fiducial homentropic
calculation in \citetalias{lin12} by setting $\gamma=5/3$ (case
0). Then $W=Q$ since $\ils=\ihs\equiv0$ (Eq. \ref{lin_energy}). This also
serves as a test for our numerical method. The eigenfrequency and
perturbations shown in Table \ref{linsims} and
Fig. \ref{homentropic_case} agrees well with \citetalias{lin12}. In
co-rotation region $R\in[0.8,1.2]r_0$, $W$ is nearly independent
of height and the vortex core has upwards motion.

\end{figure}


%a non-homentropic case in detail
\subsection{Nonhomentropic example}
We now examine case 3a with $\gamma=2.5,\,\Gamma=1.67$. The
eigenfrequecy $\sigma$ is close to case 0, but the growth rate
is slightly larger in the nonhomentropic disk.    

Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case} shows the pressure, density and
entropy perturbations at several heights. Near $r_0$,  pressure
and density perturbations increase with height, unlike the homentropic case
where $W$ has weak $z$-dependence. Nonhomentropic disks  
generally have $W\ne Q$, as shown in
Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case}. The difference between $W$ and $Q$
at the midplane is due to background radial entropy gradients $\ils$ 
since $\ihs(r,0)=0$.  

At co-rotation, {\bf the density perturbation} $Q$ increases with height faster than the pressure
perturbation $W$, which  results in a negative entropy perturbation. This
is consistent with the requirement $S=(1-\gamma/\Gamma)W$ at the upper
disk boundary. It is clear that $S$ has a stronger vertical dependence
than either $W$ or $Q$. 

We might have expected the above result on physical grounds. The homentropic case indicate
upward motion at the vortex core. If a positive (stable) vertical 
entropy gradient is introduced, then a fluid element displaced upwards should increase its density compared to the 
surrounding background, i.e. $Q>0$, and this should become more positive with height because 
vertical velocities increase in magnitude with height. The pressure perturbation is not expected 
to change as rapidly, because the fluid element can establish pressure 
equilibrium with its surroundings. 

%, but $|S|$ is somewhat small compared to $W,\,Q$  at the vortex core.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Entropy perturbation} 
We plot the entropy perturbation $S$ at $z=0$ and $z=0.8H$ in   
Fig. \ref{2dflow}. The figures are overlaid by the perturbed
horizontal flow, which are similar at both heights. The anti-cyclonic
flow pattern is commonly found in previous studies
\citep[e.g.][]{li00,li01}. Entropy gradients of this magnitude do not
affect this characteristic feature of the RWI.    

Therefore, we could have inferred some of the features in
Fig. \ref{2dflow} without solving the fluid equations {, by invoking entropy advection.} 
Consider the linearized energy equation near co-rotation where $\sbar \simeq
-\imgi\nu$ (which is close to $r_0$), 
%We can infer some of the features in Fig. \ref{2dflow} 
%% Near the co-rotation radius where $\sbar=-\imgi\nu$ (which is close
%% to the bump radius), the energy equation is approximately  
\begin{align}\label{entropy_gen}
  \dd s \sim -\nu^{-1}\dd\bm{v}\cdot\nabla s, 
\end{align}
and $\nu>0$ for a growing mode. Eq. \ref{entropy_gen} is only valid
within a small distance $\epsilon \ll \nu/|m\Omega_0^\prime|$ from
$r_0$. In this example, $\nu/|m\Omega_0^\prime|\simeq 0.02r_0$.  

%% The midplane entropy increases globally in the radial direction with a
%% dip at $r_0$,
{\bf The midplane entropy has a dip at the bump radius but it increases globally in the
radial direction, so $\p_rs>0$ at $r_0$.}     
This naturally implies that inward (outward) radial flow  for
$\phi<\phi_0$ ($\phi>\phi_0$), i.e. anti-cyclonic motion, brings about
a local entropy increase (decrease) near $r_0$ at $z=0$. 
We recognize the qualitative similarity between the midplane flow pattern
in Fig. \ref{2dflow} and horseshoe turns induced by an embedded
planet. Entropy advection then leads to large radial entropy gradients
\citep{paardekooper10}, which can be seen in
Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case} on either side of $r_0$ at the
midplane. This gradient is, of course, growing exponentially in time, so it 
may be important even within the linear regime.  
%the linear baroclinic source for omega_z does not involve 
%radial derivative of ds (because it is multiplied by azi deriv of eqm pressure which is zero)
%but radial derivative of S will be involved in the nonlinear terms i.e.
% (phi deriv of dp) times (r deriv of s), and r deriv of s is large
%so even though we are working in the linear regime, this higher order nonlinear term (ignored in linear theory)  may 
%actually be significant because of the large r-deriv of s 

%the linear baroclinic source for omega_z involve
% (r deriv of p) times (azi deriv of ds)    and
% (r deriv of p) times (azi deriv of Q)     
%first term  might be large (Q ~ maximized at vortex core)
%ds changes sign across phi_0. so azi deriv of ds significant -> POSITIVE omega_z source (because r deriv of p usually negative). 


%That is, material of higher (lower) entropy moves to a region
%of lower (higher) background entropy.
%% Therefore, we could have used Eq. \ref{entropy_gen} to infer the local
%% entropy perturbation without solving the linear problem. Consider
%% first the midplane where only radial motions contribute to $\dd
%% s$. 
%% The perturbation is localized about an entropy dip at
%Away from the midplane we can assume vertical 
In the vertical dimension, if we assume the flow at
$(r_0,\phi_0)$ is unchanged from the homentropic case (i.e. upward),
then since the background entropy increases with height, the local
Eulerian entropy perturbation at the vortex core must become negative
away from the midplane, as observed.

Related to the entropy perturbation is the quantity $\bar{S}\equiv
Q-\gamma W/\Gamma$. Its 
distribution shown in Fig. \ref{Sbar} agrees with expectations made in
\S\ref{baroclinic_effects}, namely it is mostly negative, with a local
minimum at the vortex core.

    can be expected without solving the linear problem (see
    \S\ref{baroclinic_effects}).

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{{\bf Vertical vorticity perturbation} }
{\bf
Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_vortz_rp}---\ref{nonhomentropic_case_vortz}
shows the perturbation 
to vertical vorticity,
$\delta\omega_z\equiv\hat{\bm{z}}\cdot\nabla\times\delta\bm{v}$, in
the horizontal and meridional planes, respectively. These plots 
agree with the identification of the linear RWI with a pair of edge-waves
propagating in the $\pm\phi$ directions along radial potential
vorticity gradients on either side of the bump radius $r_0$
\citep{umurhan10}. 

The background vorticity $\omega_z$ has a dip at
$r_0$. Then the positive/negative regions of $\delta\omega_z$ in
Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_vortz_rp} is broadly consistent with the
advection of $\omega_z$ by the perturbed horizontal flow, in a similar
manner as the advection of entropy described in the previous section.   

Although the perturbed flow in the nonhomentropic case 
consists of vorticity columns (Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_vortz}), 
$\mathrm{max}(|\delta\omega_z|)$ in fact increases slightly away from the midplane.     
This contrasts to \citeauthor{umurhan10}'s analytical model of the RWI in polytropic disks, 
where horizontal velocities, and hence $\delta\omega_z$, have no vertical dependence.

\subsubsection{{\bf Meridional vortical flow and tilted vorticity columns}}
Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_dvz} shows the perturbed velocity field
in the $(r,z)$ plane, with a map of the baroclinic source term defined
in \S\ref{baroclinic_effects}. The flow pattern is similar to the
homentropic case in that it is still converging toward $r_0$, and
vertical motion is predominantly upwards there. However, there is a
notable difference from the homentropic case --- vortical 
motion (of positive azimuthal vorticity) centered about 
$(r,z)=(1.02r_0,0.5H)$. It coincides with a region where the
azimuthal baroclinic source term is positive. Note that the sign of
the baroclinic source {\bf away from the midplane --- being positive
  (negative) for $r>r_0$ ($r<r_0$) ---} is roughly consistent with
expectations made in 
\S\ref{baroclinic_effects}.

    the perturbed velocity field projected onto this plane.

\end{figure}

%% \subsubsubsection{Tilted voricity}

  Vortical motion in the meridional plane also correlates to 
  misalignment between a column of negative vertical vorticity perturbation and  
  the vertical direction. {\bf This is demonstrated in 
    Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_vort3d_pz} where 
    contours of $\delta\omega_z$ are shown to be 
    tilted in the $(\phi,z)$ plane. 
    We can quantify this tilt by
    calculating $1-\avg{\cos{\theta}}_Z$, where
    \begin{align*} 
      \cos{\theta} \equiv
      \left.|\p_\phi\delta\omega_z|\right/\left[(\p_Z\delta\omega_z)^2 + (\p_\phi\delta\omega_z)^2\right]^{1/2}
    \end{align*}
    and $\avg{\cdot}_Z$ denotes averaging over the vertical direction 
    at fixed $\phi=\phi_0$ shown in
    Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_vort3d_pz}. 

    For the nonhomentropic case 3a, we find
    $1-~\avg{\cos{\theta}}_Z=0.011$. This value should be compared with the 
    homentropic case 0 where $1-~\avg{\cos{\theta}}_Z=~3.4\times10^{-5}$
    and the tilt is hardly noticeable.   
 
    We rationalize the small tilt observed in Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_vort3d_pz} 
    by interpreting the nonhomentropic solution as a small deviation 
    from the homentropic case, for which the tilt is negligible and 
    lines of constant $\delta\omega_z <0 $ are parallel to the vertical axis. 
    %    This implies that \emph{local} anti-cylonic motion, associated with $\delta\omega_z<0$, is horizontal. 
    Now consider baroclinity as a perturbation to this configuration.  
    
    The discussion in \S\ref{baroclinic_effects}, together with Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_dvz}, 
    suggests that baroclinity gives rise to positive 
    azimuthal vorticity (as evident from the meridional flow pattern).
    We can produce azimuthal vorticity by tilting a 
    vertical column negative of $\dd\omega_z$ in the azimuthal direction indicated in 
    Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_vort3d_pz}. By such a tilt, what was purely 
    horizontal \emph{local} anti-cyclonic motion, associated with $\dd\omega_z<0$ being a vertical column, now has a non-zero projection
    onto the meridional plane. This results in the meridional vortical motion demanded by the baroclinity in
    nonhomentropic flow. In other words, baroclinity has converted some of the horizontal motion of the 
    homentropic flow into vertical motion. 

%      If we consider baroclinity as a small 
%      perturbation to the homentropic solution, then a way to achieve
%      (positive) azimuthal vorticity, as
%      demanded by baroclinity, is a small tilt
%      shown in Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case_vort3d_pz}.

\subsubsection{$m=5$}
%HR similar result, slender disk similar result 
The meridional flow varies with $m$. Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_m5} shows
the $m=5$ solution for the 
setup of case 3a. We focus on the region $R\in[0.9,1.1]r_0$ because
higher-$m$ modes are not as well-localized as low-$m$
\citep{lin11a}. %unless strongly unstable %solution %may be influenced by simple bc  
It displays stronger vortical motion than
the fiducial run with $m=3$, even though the growth rates are similar
($\nu/m\Omega_0=0.1051$ for $m=5$). The pressure and density
perturbations have noticeable vertical structure, with $W$ typically
increasing away from the midplane. This qualitatively differs from
homentropic cases.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Solid upper boundary}
In the above example, it is perhaps not surprising that entropy
perturbations became more negative away from the midplane, because the free
boundary condition demands $|Q|>|W|$ at $Z=Z_s$.  

We have re-calculated this mode with a solid upper disk boundary
(case 3b). Numerically, this condition forces $W\simeq Q$ at 
$Z=Z_s$. Fig. \ref{novperp} shows the ratio of pressure to 
density perturbation. The entropy perturbation at
intermediate heights is still typically negative, suggesting this to
be an intrinsic feature of the instability in these disk models. The
flow pattern is very similar to case 3a.

\subsection{Effect of $\gamma$ on vertical flow}
When $\gamma\neq\Gamma$, the presence of buoyancy forces is expected
to modify the vertical flow associated with the RWI. In
Fig. \ref{compare_dvz} we compare the vertical velocity at the
vortex core for a range of $\gamma$. 
%Although we are
%effectively comparing gas of different thermodynamic properties, this
%set of runs is useful because the disks have indentical background
%density, pressure and velocity profiles.

\end{figure}

As we increase $\gamma$, the magnitude of vertical flow
increases, with an increasingly complicated $z$-dependence. In the 
homentropic case ($\gamma=1.67=\Gamma$), $\delta v_z $ is essentially linear in
$z$, consistent with the analytical models of \cite{umurhan10}.  
{\bf For $\gamma=2.5>\Gamma$, near the midplane $\delta v_z$ is still linear in
$z$, but away from $z=0$ the increase in $\dd v_z$ starts to level
off at $z=0.3H$ due to the development of meridional vortical motion. The leveling off 
occurs for both types of upper disk boundary conditions.

%meridional vortical motion away from the midplane.
This results in a `step' in the case of a
solid upper boundary (centered about $z=0.5H$), but for the free upper boundary 
$\dd v_z$ increases again at large $z$. Since the RWI
is a global instability in the vertical direction, vertical
boundary conditions can affect the flow throughout the fluid 
column, though the extent of which depends on the equation of state
\citep[][see also \S\ref{isothermal}]{lin12c}.

}    

{\bf Let us examine the different contributions to vertical motion at
  co-rotation.} At $(r_0,\phi_0)$, the vertical velocity is roughly 
\begin{align}\label{core_dvz}
  %  \dd v_z = \frac{\imgi}{\sbar H}\left[\frac{\p W}{\p Z} -
  %    \frac{2nZ}{(1-Z^2)}\left(W - \frac{\Gamma}{\gamma}Q\right)\right].  
  \dd v_z \sim -\frac{1}{\nu H}\left[\smash{\underbrace{\frac{\p W}{\p
          Z}}_\dagger} \!\!\!\phantom{\frac{1}{1}} +\phantom{\frac{1}{1}}\!\!\!
    \smash{\underbrace{\frac{2nZ\Gamma}{\gamma(1-Z^2)}\left(Q
      -\frac{\gamma}{\Gamma}W\right)}_\ddagger}\right].  \\ \notag
\end{align}

This equation is obtained from Eq. \ref{vz} by evaluating it 
at co-rotation radius (where
$\sbar\simeq -\ii\nu$), and inserting expressions for the
pressure length-scale for polytropic backgrounds. 
The first term ($\dagger$) represent pressure forces and is present
for all values of $\gamma$. For homentropic flow, ($\dagger$) is
the only source of vertical motion, and in this case $W$ decreases
with height. The second term ($\ddagger$) is only present if $\gamma\neq\Gamma$. 
Recall the quantity $Q-\gamma W/\Gamma=\bar{S}$ defined in
\S\ref{baroclinic_effects}, where it appeared as a baroclinic source term and 
we argued $\bar{S}\leq0$ at the vortex core (see also Fig. \ref{Sbar}). Then at the vortex core,
($\ddagger$) contributes positively to $\dd v_z$ along the vertical
direction, but vanishes at endpoints.     

In the nonhomentropic example (case 3a, $\gamma=2.5$) the
function $W$ increases with height at the vortex core (Fig. \ref{nonhomentropic_case}),
implying ($\dagger$) contributes negatively to $\dd v_z$. {\bf 
  The contribution from ($\ddagger$) and $(\dagger)$ have opposite
  signs, but} the fact
that we observe positive vertical velocity shows that ($\ddagger$) is 
typically larger in magnitude than ($\dagger$). {\bf That is,
  baroclinity typically outweigh vertical pressure gradients.}
  
\subsubsection{The role of $N_z^2\neq 0$}\label{nz_nonzero}
Notice even when $\gamma$ is only slightly larger than $\Gamma$,
the vortex core vertical velocity is quite different from the homentropic case 
(i.e. case 1 with $\gamma/\Gamma=1.08$ in Fig. \ref{compare_dvz}). To see the role of entropy gradients, 
or equivalently the effect of non-zero buoyancy frequency, we follow \cite{kato01} and 
make the following approximations. For generality, below 
we shall not specialize to a polytropic background. 

Consider a height at which $\ihs\gg\ils$, which is generally
true away from the midplane of a thin disk. Furthermore, suppose radial 
velocities are not much larger than vertical velocities in the region of interest (co-rotation). 
Then we can neglect the $\dd v_r$ term in the linearized energy equation, and eliminate $Q$ between 
Eq. \ref{vz} and Eq. \ref{lin_energy} to obtain,
\begin{align}\label{vz_approx} 
%\dd v_z \simeq \frac{\imgi}{\sbar}\left[\frac{\p W}{\p z} + \left(\frac{\p\ln{\rho}}{\p z} - \frac{1}{H_p}\right)\right]
%+\frac{N_z^2}{\sbar^2}\dd v_z,
\dd v_z \simeq -\frac{1}{\nu}\left[\frac{\p W}{\p z} + \left(\frac{\p\ln{\rho}}{\p z} - \frac{1}{H_p}\right)W\right]
-\frac{N_z^2}{\nu^2}\dd v_z,
\end{align}
which is \citeauthor{kato01}'s Eq. 21 evaluated at co-rotation. 
Because $\nu\ll\Omega_0$ for the modes considered and $N_z\sim \Omega$ away from the midplane, 
for nonhomentropic flow we have $N_z^2/\nu^2\gg1$ and should expect the balance
\begin{align}\label{kato_vz}
\dd v_z \sim  -\frac{\nu}{N_z^2}\frac{\p W}{\p z} 
 \underbrace{- \frac{\nu}{N_z^2}\left( \frac{\p\ln{\rho}}{\p z} 
- \frac{1}{H_p} \right)W}_{- \nu\rho\left(\frac{\p p}{\p z} \right)^{-1}W}, \quad N_z^2\neq0%\\
%&=  -\frac{\nu}{N_z^2}\frac{\p W}{\p z} - \nu\rho\left(\frac{\p p}{\p z} \right)^{-1}W \notag
\end{align}
near co-rotation radius.
The second term on the RHS is just buoyancy (and does not
explicitly depend on $\gamma$). This expression should be compared with
that for strictly homentropic flow, 

%% Comparing the coefficient of $\p_zW$ in this expression to that in
%% the strictly homentropic case, where 
\begin{align*}
  \dd v_z \sim -\frac{1}{\nu}\frac{\p W}{\p z}, \quad N_z^2\equiv 0. 
\end{align*}

We see that for $N_z\equiv0$, pressure gradients are entirely
responsible for vertical flow, whereas for $N_z\neq0$, $\dd v_z$ is result of
a combination of pressure and buoyancy forces. The importance of
pressure gradients also differ, because the coefficients of $\p_zW$ are different
in each case (by a factor $\nu^2/N_z^2$). 
Furthermore, the ratio of the first to second term in
Eq. \ref{kato_vz} is approximately 
\begin{align}
  \frac{(\nu/N_z^2)\p W/\p z}{\nu\rho(\p p/\p z)^{-1}W}\sim
  \frac{\Omega^2}{N_z^2}\frac{\p\ln{W}}{\p\ln{z}}.
\end{align}
Since $N_z$ increases with height, far away from the midplane we
expect buoyancy forces to dominate in the nonhomentropic case. 

We
conclude that the origin of vertical motion {\bf at co-rotation} is qualitatively different
between homentropic and nonhomentropic flow (especially away 
from the midplane), as suggested by numerical results in the
previous section. 


\subsection{Fixed $\gamma$, variable $\Gamma$}\label{varpolyn}
We now fix the adiabatic index to $\gamma=1.4$, as is typical for 
accretion disk models. Then we require $n>2.5$ for axisymmetric stability. 
With other parameters fixed, increasing $n$ would decrease the bump in 
disk thickness and reduce growth rates \citepalias{lin12}. 
To avoid potential numerical issues associated with small $|\sbar|$ at
co-rotation, we adopt $h=0.2$ for cases 5---8, so that growth rates
remain $O(0.1\Omega_0)$. 
 

Table \ref{linsims} shows that by setting $\gamma\neq\Gamma=1.33$ (case 6), 
thereby introducing entropy gradients, $\avg{\theta_m}$ has increased 
from the homentropic case 5. This is consistent with the trend in 
cases 0---4.    

\citetalias{lin12} found that when $n$ is increased but other
parameters fixed,  the flow at the vortex core became less
three-dimensional. For cases 5---8, we find the average value of  
$\theta_m$, when taken over $R\in[0.98,1.02]r_0$, is 
$0.46,\, 0.63,\, 0.61$ and $0.56$ for $n=2.5,\,3.0,\,3.5$ and $4.0$,
respectively. The flow at $(r_0,\phi_0)$ in fact becomes more
three-dimensional when it is nonhomentropic although $n$ has
increased (case 5 $\to$ case 6). 

The small decrease in the above values of three-dimensionality at
$(r_0,\phi_0)$ from $n=3.0$ to $n=4.0$ is likely related to increased 
radial flow across $r_0$ associated with vortical motion in the 
$(r,z)$ plane. Cases 6---8 display similar dependence of $\dd v_z$ on
$z$ as the nonhomentropic example (case 3a, see Fig. \ref{compare_dvz}).     

%It appears that the competing effect of
%reducing in $|\dd v_z|$ due to increased $n$ and increasing $|\dd
%v_z|$ due to increased $|\gamma-\Gamma|$ (and growth rate), 
%core vz
%3d-ness still goes up with
