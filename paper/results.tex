\subsection{MRI in self-gravitating polytropic disks with uniform
  resistivity}  
We first calculate the MRI as a function of $Q$ in a polytropic disk
with uniform resistivity ($A=1$). We consider $Q\in[0.2,4]$,
corresponding to stronly self-gravitating to non-self-gravitating
disks, for mid-plane Elsasser numbers $\Lambda_0\in[0.3,10]$. We fix $k_x=0.1$ and 
$\beta=100$. 

It is useful to first see how self-gravity may still play a role even
though density and potential perturbations are expected to be
negligible because $k_x\ll1$, i.e. the linear response is
non-self-gravitating. 
%even though the linear response is expected to be incompressible
%because $k_x\ll 1$, i.e. non-self-gravitating. 
\cite{sano99} found that the MRI wavelength, normalized by $2H$, can be estimated as
\begin{align}
  \lambda=\mathrm{max}\left(\lambda_\mathrm{ideal},\lambda_\mathrm{resis}\right), 
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \lambda_\mathrm{ideal} = \pi f v_A = \frac{\pi f}{\sqrt{\beta\rho}} 
\end{align}
is the ideal MRI wavelength, and 
\begin{align}
  \lambda_\mathrm{resis} =\frac{\pi\eta}{f v_A}=\frac{\pi f}{\Lambda_0}\sqrt{\frac{\rho}{\beta}}
\end{align}
%factor pi comes form converting vertical wavenumber to
%wavelength. linear theory works with wavenumber, physical
%interpretation in terms of wavelengths
is the MRI wavelength in the limit of high resistivity. MRI requires
$\lambda\lesssim 1$, so that the unstable wavelength fits within the
disk column. As shown in Appendix \ref{appen1} $f$ increases with the
strength of self-gravity. This is expected to increase $\lambda$ and
weaken the MRI.  


We show in Fig. the growth rates as a function of $Q$ and
$\Lambda_0$. In the limit of ideal MHD, $\Lambda_0>1$, there is
negligible dependence on $Q$ because $f$ is of order unity for the
range of $Q$ considered so $\lambda_\mathrm{ideal}$ remain less than
  unity. However, in the resistive limit, the dependence of
  $\lambda_\mathrm{resis}$ on $f$ (and hence $Q$) is amplified by
  $\Lambda_0 < 1$.
